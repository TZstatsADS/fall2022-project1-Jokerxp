    "As we know, capitalism is an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit rather than by the government. Most capitalism scholars regard that modern capitalism only fully emerged in the early modern period between the 16th and 18th centuries. Capitalism has been developing until now and most countries are basically capitalist country today around the world. However, development is imbalanced through the history. Maybe capitalism had a period of rapid development in some specific eras, while got stuck in some other eras. So a question emerges: whether there was an era that capitalism developed significant fast or not? If so, what and who contributed to it? Today I am going to explore this problem from the perspective of philosophy.\n",

From the figure above, we can see there is a significant increasement of positive, trust and anticipation score from 1817 to 1936, while negative and fear score remain stable. That means at least Keynes was optimistic about the future of capitalisim compared to Smith and Ricardo in his era, which indicated a prosperity of capitalism during his era.\n"

Before 1817, topics were mainly related to production, which can be inferred by some words like produce, labour, quantity, commoditied, etc. However, Keynes mainly focused on finance, like rate, interest, investment, marginal,capital and output. In my opinion, the transition from production to finance is one of the reasons that Keynes had a high expectation on capitalism."

    "The brighter a block is, the tighter relationship between the two schools which the block infers to. We can see the diagonal is white since one school is fully related to itself. For capitalism, the most related school is communism. An interesting thing is that all the communism documents used in this part ware publicated in the mid and late 19th century, between 1817 and 1936. More deeply, if we look at the word cloud of communism publications, we can find some common key words such as labour, value, development, but communism paid more attentions to class. We have reasons to believe the conflict between capitalism and communism promotes to the development of capitalism in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n",
